# Hi there 👋
- 👨‍💻 I'm Oualid, a developer with a passion for making the world a better place through technology. I started my coding journey in 2011 and have been exploring the possibilities of programming ever since. I'm also a big fan of science, and love learning about maths, philosophy, history, physics, chemistry, biology, and more.
- 🏢 Software Architect, Database Designer, Researcher, Analyst, Developer.
- 📍 Kenitra, Morocco.

# 🥇 My Expertise
- I possess a versatile skill set in programming languages such as JavaScript, Rust, SQL, Java, Solidity, and PHP. My expertise lies in JavaScript, with proficiency in utilizing a broad range of frameworks and tools, including Node.js, Deno, React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Qwik, Express.js, Astro.js, jQuery, Electron, Tauri, and many others. As a passionate Rust developer, I am deeply intrigued by its ability to create resilient and high-performing applications.

# ⛓️ Blockchain Enthusiast
- I'm also deeply interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. I believe that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the way we transact and interact with each other, and I'm committed to exploring the possibilities and addressing the current challenges with blockchain.

# 🥽 The Metaverse
- I'm deeply interested in the metaverse and its potential to transform the way we live, work, and interact with each other. I'm working on several projects related to the metaverse, including developing new technologies and applications that can help us realize its full potential. I believe that the metaverse can offer us new opportunities for creativity, collaboration, and innovation, and I'm excited to be a part of this emerging field.

# 🔳 Multi Computation Project
- Currently, my project is focused on advancing computation through the implementation of quaternary state systems. Quaternary computing is a form of multi-state computing that utilizes four states rather than two in binary computing. By incorporating quaternary state systems, we aim to unlock even greater efficiency, scalability, and security in computational processes compared to traditional binary computing.

- While my current focus is on quaternary state, my long-term goal is to continue working with higher-state systems, such as 16, 64, and 256-state systems. Each increase in the number of states allows for greater complexity in computational processes, and the potential for new breakthroughs in areas such as artificial intelligence, data analysis, and scientific research.

- With each new level of state, we anticipate new challenges, but also new opportunities for innovation. Our team is excited to be at the forefront of this cutting-edge research and we are committed to advancing the field of multi-state computing to new heights.

- This project aims to bring the best of both worlds together and to make computing more powerful, scalable, and secure.

# 🔥 About Zeryab
- I'm currently working on a project called Zeryab, which is a tool that gives users the ability to create beautiful apps easily. Zeryab is built with Node.js, Rust, and other programming languages, and it includes a variety of tools and features to help developers build better apps faster with their preferred programming language.

# 🦞 Rustacean
- I'm a Rustacean and I'm really interested in Rust as a programming language. I find Rust to be a powerful and expressive language that's well-suited for a wide range of applications, including systems programming, web development, and more.
